# Hello World Move Module

Welcome to the codebase for the **Hello World** Move module! This repository contains the source code and resources from the "Move 0-1" livestream conducted during the Battle of Olympus hackathon. This example module has been deployed to the Movement test network and serves as a starting point for newcomers to the Move language, focusing on the Aptos Move environment.

## Overview

This codebase is designed to help developers new to the Move language get up and running on the Movement network. The content covered in the livestream includes:

1. **Basic Move Syntax**: Introduction to the fundamental syntax and structure of the Move language.
2. **Resource-Oriented Programming**: Understanding the unique resource model in Move and how it differs from traditional programming paradigms.
3. **Movement CLI**: How to set up and use the Movement command-line interface for building and managing Move projects.
4. **Deploying to Movement Test Network**: Step-by-step guide on deploying Move modules to the Movement test network.
5. **Interacting via Aptos TS SDK**: Demonstrating how to interact with deployed Move modules using the Aptos TypeScript SDK.
